# "Predicting Food Sales"
This project aims to predict food sales for a restaurant based on historical sales data. The project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze sales patterns and forecast future sales.

**Data Source**
The data used in this project was obtained from the restaurant's point of sale system. It includes information such as the Item_Fat_Content, the Outlet_Location_Type, the Outlet_Type, the Item_Outlet_Sales and the Outlet_Establishment_Year.

**Methodology**
The project uses of regression analysis to predict future sales. Specifically, we used the following techniques:

Linear regression, to model the relationship between sales and various factors such as Item_Fat_Content, Outlet_Location_Type, and Outlet_Type.

**Results**
Our model was able to accurately predict food sales with an accuracy of 69.49%. We also identified several key factors that influence sales, such as the Item_Fat_Content and the Outlet_Location_Type.
